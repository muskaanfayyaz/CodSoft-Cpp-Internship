# Guessing Game

Welcome to the Guessing Game repository! This simple console-based C++ program allows users to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

## Introduction

The Guessing Game is a fun and interactive way to practice your guessing skills. The program generates a random number between 1 and 100, and the player's objective is to guess the correct number within the fewest attempts possible.

## Features

- Randomly generates a number between 1 and 100.
- Allows the user to input guesses and provides feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
- Counts the number of attempts taken by the user to guess the correct number.

## Usage

To play the Guessing Game, follow these steps:

1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the compiled executable file.
3. The program will prompt you to enter a guess between 1 and 100.
4. After each guess, the program will provide feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct.
5. Continue guessing until you correctly guess the number.
6. The program will display the number of attempts it took to guess the correct number.

## Example usage:

bash

$ g++ -o guessing_game guessing_game.cpp

$ ./guessing_game


## Dependencies

- None

The Guessing Game program has no external dependencies and can be compiled and run using any standard C++ compiler.

- Subtraction of two numbers
- Multiplication of two numbers
- Division of two numbers
- Module of two numbers
- Error handling for division by zero

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler 

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository or download the `calculator.cpp` file.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.
4. Enter two numbers when prompted.
5. Choose an operation to perform (+, -, *, /).
6. View the result.

## Usage Example

```bash
$ g++ calculator.cpp -o calculator
$ ./calculator
Enter two numbers: 10 5
